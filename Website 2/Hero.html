<p> For my hero I chose my father. I chose him because ever since he was 16 he would always work very hard to save up money for him and my mom. Since he worked so hard my mom has been able to stay home and not work herself. He has saved up alot of money over the years to get his 3 kids into college he has already got two into college successfully. He has also helped many people at his work showing them how to invest and making their work conditions better.</p>
